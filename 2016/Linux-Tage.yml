  Since 1999 we organise the Chemnitzer Linux-Tage with a constantly increasing success. Naturally, as time goes by some members leave the team and new ones join however some of us are involved right from the start.

  We organise the Chemnitzer Linux-Tage because we want to give the people an understanding of Linux and Open Source and it is a lot of fun to organise a meanwhile so complex event. Furthermore we get motivated again and again anew by positive responses of visitors.

  Additional details about the conference are available at
