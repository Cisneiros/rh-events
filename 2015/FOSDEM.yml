    FOSDEM is a free and non-commercial event organised
    by the community for the community. The goal is to
    provide open source software developers and communities
    a place to meet to:

    * get in touch with other developers and projects;
    * be informed about the latest developments in the
      open source world;
    * attend interesting talks and presentations on
      various topics by open source project leaders
      and committers;
    * to promote the development and the benefits of
      open source solutions.

    The Clouds, Containers, and Orchestration miniconf will 
    focus on the open source tools and best practices for working 
    with cloud tools, containers, and orchestration software 
    (e.g., Kubernetes, Apache Mesos, geard, and others). 
    Leading developers and users who are deploying the tools in 
    real production environments will demo and share their knowledge, 
    and show where tools will be going in 2015.

    People often complain about the quality of open source project 
    documentation. At the same time, documentation is a great place to 
    get started contributing to an open source community. This miniconf 
    will explore practical aspects of Open Source documentation, 
    with an eye to applying them right away. The session will cover:
    
    * popular markup languages (Docbook, DITA, markdown, etc)
    * version control systems for writers (SVN, git, etc)
    * getting started as a contributor (how to pick a project, getting an 
    account, meeting the community, your first commit, etc)
    * documentation skills and methodologies (topic-based authoring, 
    single sourcing, minimalism, etc)
    
- title: Connecting Containers: Building a PaaS with Docker and Kubernetes
  speaker: Katie Miller
  start: 2015-01-15 16:35 UTC+12:00

    Learn how Red Hat is using Docker and Google's Kubernetes project to redefine 
    modern application platform services. New container-centric tools for managing 
    resources in the cloud have helped to establish new best practices, prompting a 
    redesign of Red Hat's open source OpenShift Platform as a Service. This talk 
    will give an overview of Docker, Kubernetes and the container-focused Atomic OS, 
    and explain how these open source building blocks have been used to create the 
    next generation OpenShift V3 PaaS.
