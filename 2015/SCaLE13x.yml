  SCALE 13x – the 13th annual Southern California Linux Expo – will be
  held at the Hilton Los Angeles Airport hotel. As the first-of-the-year
  Linux and Free/Open Source Software (FOSS) expo in North America,
  SCALE 13x expects to host more than 100 exhibitors this year, along
  with nearly 130 sessions, tutorials, and special events. Held annually
  in Los Angeles, SCALE is the largest community-run FOSS conference in
  North America.

    You've seen Cloud in the press for years, and you have a pretty good
    idea of what that means, but what's OpenStack? In this talk, you'll
    get the high-level view of what OpenStack is, what all the moving
    parts do, and how they fit together. We'll also talk about the
    OpenStack Foundation, and how the project is governed.
    Topics covered will include:
    * The various parts of the stack
    * How they communicate with one another
    * How to spin up an OpenStack private cloud
    * How the OpenStack Foundation operates, and a brief history of the project
    * How to get involved in the OpenStack project
    * What the alternate cloud infrastructure platforms are

- title: Solving the Package Problem (Or Making It Infinitely Worse?)

    We've come a long, long way since the days of installing software by
    compiling source nd shoving it onto a system with `make install`.
    Last year, Docker containers were heralded as a way out of the
    complexities of managing software - but today we're faced with
    a slew of container offerings and things look more complex than
    ever. What's the solution? In this presentation we'll look at
    a number of next-generation technologies for managing applications,
    such as:
    * OStree/rpm-ostree
    * Software Collections
    * Docker, Rocket, and LXC
    * dnf
    We'll talk about the options in front of developers and admins
    today, how they can navigate all the new shiny technologies that
    promise better software delivery and management, and what the rest
    of 2015 is likely to bring.

- title: Solving (NP-Hard) Scheduling Problems with oVirt and OptaPlanner
  speaker: Jason Brooks
  start: 2015-02-21 18:00 PDT

    Certain scheduling tasks, such as selecting the host to launch a new
    VM or receive a migrating VM, are central to every cloud and
    virtualization management system. These systems use rules to make
    scheduling decisions, but rules alone leave certain efficiency gains
    unrealized. Version 3.5 of oVirt, the open source virtual datacenter
    management system, included a new VM scheduling optimizer based on
    the OptaPlanner project. While working within policy constraints set
    by an administrator, this service performs probabalistic analysis of
    the environment to suggest how best to assign host resources.
    In this talk, learn about:
    * The machine reassignment problem and how it relates to oVirt
    * What OptaPlanner is and how it addresses the problem
    * How the oVirt project developed and integrated this functionality
    * Future directions for the feature
    * Applicability of this technology in other project

- title: Understanding FOSS Licenses (without a Lawyer)
  speaker: Tom Callaway
  start: 2015-02-21 18:00 PDT

    Free and Open Source licenses are a key part of how FOSS works, but
    most of us do not fully understand how (or why) they work. After
    reviewing more than 350 FOSS licenses for Fedora (over the course of
    10 years), Tom has seen almost everything and can share his wisdom
    with you. In this talk, he'll cover the commonly used FOSS licenses,
    describe how they work, and even point out some of the unique
    licenses on the fringe of our universe. Bonus: he's been reading
    Legalese for years (as a non-lawyer who regularly works with
    lawyers at Red Hat), so he can translate licenses back to English.
    He will also cover:
    * the fundamentals of copyrights, trademarks, and patents
    * Public Domain
    * FOSS licenses for non-software works
    * Multiple license scenarios
    * How to choose the right license
    * Why you should never, ever, ever write your own license
