    You've seen Cloud in the press for years, and you have a pretty good
    idea of what that means, but what's OpenStack? In this talk, you'll
    get the high-level view of what OpenStack is, what all the moving
    parts do, and how they fit together. We'll also talk about the
    OpenStack Foundation, and how the project is governed.

    Topics covered will include:

    * The various parts of the stack
    * How they communicate with one another
    * How to spin up an OpenStack private cloud
    * How the OpenStack Foundation operates, and a brief history of the project
    * How to get involved in the OpenStack project
    * What the alternate cloud infrastructure platforms are

- title: Solving the Package Problem (Or Making It Infinitely Worse?)

    We've come a long, long way since the days of installing software by
    compiling source nd shoving it onto a system with `make install`.
    Last year, Docker containers were heralded as a way out of the
    complexities of managing software - but today we're faced with
    a slew of container offerings and things look more complex than
    ever. What's the solution? In this presentation we'll look at
    a number of next-generation technologies for managing applications,
    such as:

    * OStree/rpm-ostree
    * Software Collections
    * Docker, Rocket, and LXC
    * dnf

    We'll talk about the options in front of developers and admins
    today, how they can navigate all the new shiny technologies that
    promise better software delivery and management, and what the rest
    of 2015 is likely to bring.

- title: Solving (NP-Hard) Scheduling Problems with oVirt and OptaPlanner
  speaker: Jason Brooks
  start: 2015-02-21 18:00 PDT
  end: 2013-11-31 19:00 PDT
  description: |
    Certain scheduling tasks, such as selecting the host to launch a new
    VM or receive a migrating VM, are central to every cloud and
    virtualization management system. These systems use rules to make
    scheduling decisions, but rules alone leave certain efficiency gains
    unrealized. Version 3.5 of oVirt, the open source virtual datacenter
    management system, included a new VM scheduling optimizer based on
    the OptaPlanner project. While working within policy constraints set
    by an administrator, this service performs probabalistic analysis of
    the environment to suggest how best to assign host resources.

    In this talk, learn about:

    * The machine reassignment problem and how it relates to oVirt
    * What OptaPlanner is and how it addresses the problem
    * How the oVirt project developed and integrated this functionality
    * Future directions for the feature
    * Applicability of this technology in other project

- title: Understanding FOSS Licenses (without a Lawyer)
  speaker: Tom Callaway
  start: 2015-02-21 18:00 PDT
  end: 2015-02-21 19:00 PDT
  description: |
    Free and Open Source licenses are a key part of how FOSS works, but
    most of us do not fully understand how (or why) they work. After
    reviewing more than 350 FOSS licenses for Fedora (over the course of
    10 years), Tom has seen almost everything and can share his wisdom
    with you. In this talk, he'll cover the commonly used FOSS licenses,
    describe how they work, and even point out some of the unique
    licenses on the fringe of our universe. Bonus: he's been reading
    Legalese for years (as a non-lawyer who regularly works with
    lawyers at Red Hat), so he can translate licenses back to English.

    He will also cover:

    * The fundamentals of copyrights, trademarks, and patents
    * Public Domain
    * FOSS licenses for non-software works
    * Multiple license scenarios
    * How to choose the right license
    * Why you should never, ever, ever write your own license
    
- title: Gluster Quickstart
  speaker: Thomas Cameron
  start: 2015-02-22 13:30 PDT

  description: |
    GlusterFS was developed as a distributed filesystem in the oil and gas/high 
    performance compute arena. Using GlusterFS, flexible distributed storage can 
    easily be set up using commodity x86 hardware. Simple, inexpensive internal 
    or JBOD storage can be linked across multiple physical servers and presented 
    as a single storage namespace. This storage can be used for log file, web 
    content, virtual machine, and other storage use cases. Red Hat's Thomas 
    Cameron will demonstrate the steps involved in installing Gluster, configuring 
    disks, linking the Gluster nodes, defining storage bricks, and presenting that 
    storage to clients. He'll talk about tips and tricks, best practices, backup 
    and recovery, and more.

- title: Confessions of a Reluctant Tweeter -- Social Media for Open Source Projects
  speaker: Rikki Endsley
  start: 2015-02-20 15:45 PDT

    Do you cringe when you see #hashtags? Do you roll your eyes at "social media gurus"? 
    Social media should save time (not suck it), but you don't have to be a community 
    manager or have a communications background to leverage the power of 140 characters. 
    With a few quick and easy tips, your open source project can use social media to 
    communicate with contributors, grow its community, and share news and announcements.
    Already love IRC and email lists? Great! This talk will explain how using social media -- 
    such as Twitter, G+, and Facebook -- can complement those good ole reliable communication 
    methods. You also will learn how to determine which social media accounts your project 
    needs, what content to post (and when to post it), who to follow, and how to determine 
    whether your approach is working. Find out how to avoid being the center of an ugly 
    Twitter storm (or pull yourself out when it's too late), and how to keep from being 
    super boring or becoming a spamtastic yawn fest. Using well-known open source projects 
    as examples, this talk will show how one account doubled its followers in three months, 
    and a new open source project had 435 followers the week it launched. This talk 
    provides a crash course in social media to help your project effectively manage its 
    messages and connect with its community.

- title: Community Building the Open Source Way
  speaker: Jason Hibbets
  start: 2015-02-20 17:00 PDT
  end: 2015-02-20 18:00 PDT

    Over the past five years, Jason Hibbets has been the community manager behind 
    Opensource.com, an online publication focused on highlighting the use of open 
    source methodologies in areas outside of technology. He’ll provide a case study of 
    the content strategy and community building effort for the Opensource.com publication, 
    a project sponsored by Red Hat. You’ll go behind the scenes and see the nuts-and-bolts, 
    the tools, the metrics, and the strategy that’s helped this project grow to over 500,000 
    page views a month. This session will:

    * go in-depth on how to build a great team, including the different methodologies used from the team
    * provide details on social media and SEO strategies
    * outline our community moderator program
    * show metrics and results monitored by the team

- title: How to Thoroughly Insult and Offend People in Your Open Source Communities
  speaker: Gina Likins
  start: 2015-02-20 13:15 PDT
  end: 2015-02-20 14:15 PDT
  description: |
    The tone and tenor of conversations in a community is a large part of whether a 
    community succeeds, yet that’s often a hard concept to model and understand. Using a 
    humorous approach, Gina will demonstrate behaviors that create a hostile community 
    (and by contrast, those that create a welcoming community). She’ll look at the  
    Defcon Insult Scale for Conversations (the DIScon level), from mildly insulting to 
    abusive, and at key signifiers of each level. Audience members will be encouraged to 
    share their own perceptions of how it feels to be at different DIScon levels. Then she'll 
    tackle the more subtle forms of riling folks up (ways you can assume ignorance, belittle 
    people, and/or just be condescending). She's even created a starter list of helpful 
    phrases that people can use as writing prompts when they want to ensure that folks take 
    things the wrong way (phrases like “You may have noticed” and “I’d just like to point out” 
    and “I don’t mean to be [a pedant, sexist, etc], but…”). She'll conclude with steps 
    individuals can take to reduce the “DIScon level” of the communities in which they participate.
  
  - title: Linux Charcuterie - How the Distribution Sausage Is Made
  speaker: Ian McLeod
  start: 2015-02-22 15:00 PDT
  end: 2015-02-22 16:00 PDT

    Distribution build systems are interesting  beasts, complex and with many moving parts. 
    In the past year, containers, Project Atomic, and other changes have forced a rapid  
    evolution in how we consume source and deliver a distribution. This talk will take a look 
    at the entire chain of building a distribution from start to finish. Ian will look at how 
    source is packaged and built, and then how complex combinations of packages are joined 
    together to make a cohesive Linux distribution that successfully installs and runs in a 
    diverse set of environments - from aging x86 hardware to public cloud environments, Linux 
    containers, and immutable systems. He'll talk about the security considerations, collaboration 
    between hundreds (thousands?) of packagers, and working on the engine while the car is running.
